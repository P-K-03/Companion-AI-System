  {
    "sender_id": "Oliver",
    "age": 23,
    "text": "Dude, that sounds like a nightmare. You might honestly be better off just watching a stream or something tonight instead of torturing your hardware. I remember when I tried playing on my old work laptop and it literally shut itself down from overheating after ten minutes."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Tyler",
    "age": 22,
    "text": "Yeah, I think I'm gonna call it quits. It's overheating so bad I could probably cook an egg on the keyboard right now. I'll just hop on Discord on my phone and chat while you guys play if that's cool? I don't want to miss the banter even if I can't play."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Oliver",
    "age": 23,
    "text": "Yeah, for sure, hop in the voice channel. Mike is already on, he's ranting about his new job again. Apparently, his boss made him stay late to reorganize the entire inventory system manually because the software crashed. He needs the moral support."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Tyler",
    "age": 22,
    "text": "Oh man, Mike always has the worst luck with jobs. I'll join in a sec. By the way, for Saturday, are we bringing just beer or should I grab something stronger? I saw that tequila was on sale at the store down the street, figured it might be good for shots later."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Oliver",
    "age": 23,
    "text": "Honestly, tequila sounds dangerous considering how last time went, but I'm down if you are. Just remember that we promised to help him move that couch on Sunday morning, so if we get too wrecked, that's going to be absolutely miserable for everyone involved."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Tyler",
    "age": 22,
    "text": "Oh god, I completely forgot about the couch situation. Maybe we stick to beer and maybe just one bottle of something decent. I do not want to be lifting heavy furniture while hungover, that is a recipe for disaster and probably a back injury."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Oliver",
    "age": 23,
    "text": "Smart move. Stick to the light stuff. Also, Sarah texted me asking if she could bring her new boyfriend to the hangout. I told her I'd check with Mike first, but I feel like it might be a bit awkward considering the history there. What do you think?"
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Tyler",
    "age": 22,
    "text": "Whoa, that is definitely a curveball. I mean, it's been a while, so it shouldn't be too weird, but Mike might be a bit weird about it since he used to have a crush on her back in the day. Definitely clear it with him before giving her the green light."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Oliver",
    "age": 23,
    "text": "Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I'll call him after this match and feel it out. If he hesitates even a little bit, I'll just tell her it's a 'guys only' night or something to save the vibe. Better safe than sorry."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Oliver",
    "age": 23,
    "text": "Just got off the phone with Mike. He said Sarah can come, but he was super cagey about it. Just a lot of 'yeah, whatever is fine.' Not his usual excited self, so we're officially on babysitting duty to make sure no awkward silences happen between them."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Tyler",
    "age": 22,
    "text": "Told you! He still has a thing for her, bless his heart. We need to run interference on Saturday, make sure no awkward silences happen. I'll take the lead on the banter and we'll keep the groups separated until Mike is sufficiently lubricated."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Oliver",
    "age": 23,
    "text": "Good lookin' out. So, no shots, just beer and maybe some wine for Sarah? We should text Mike later to confirm the time, maybe around 8:30? That gives me enough time to shower and pretend I didn't spend the day covered in warehouse dust."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Tyler",
    "age": 22,
    "text": "8:30 is perfect. I'll pick up a 12-pack and maybe a cheap bottle of Merlot to look classy. Don't worry about the snacks, I'll grab some of those fancy chips you like—you know, the sour cream and onion ones? You deserve them."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Oliver",
    "age": 23,
    "text": "You're a hero. Anyway, switching gears, I have a callback interview scheduled for the design firm on Friday afternoon. Totally forgot to tell you earlier because my brain has been mush from all the heavy lifting this week."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Tyler",
    "age": 22,
    "text": "HOLY CRAP, that's amazing news! See? I told you your portfolio was killer. When is it? You're gonna crush it, just be yourself, show them why they need you, and remember all the things we talked about regarding your pay rate."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Oliver",
    "age": 23,
    "text": "It's at 2 PM. I'm honestly trying not to freak out. It's the final round, so if I mess this up, I'm back to square one with the warehouse life. Wish I could practice the presentation portion with someone before then."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Tyler",
    "age": 22,
    "text": "We can totally practice tomorrow! I can play the role of the intimidating art director. I'll come up with some tough, obscure questions about design theory. Just think of it as a low-stakes drill to get the jitters out. We've got this."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Oliver",
    "age": 23,
    "text": "Okay, that would actually help a ton. Thanks man. I really appreciate the backup. Gotta start drafting some detailed answers for the standard 'where do you see yourself' questions now. Talk to you tomorrow for the prep session."
  },
  {
    "sender_id": "Tyler",
    "age": 22,
    "text": "Anytime, brother. Get some rest tonight, you deserve it after that warehouse shift and leg day. Focus on recovering. See ya in the morning for interview bootcamp. Get those gains, get that job."
